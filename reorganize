```

- **Each app/service** (`pinksync`, `deafauth`, `fibonrose`) goes in its own folder.
- **API documentation** is in `/openapi`.
- **Interactive Swagger UI** is in `/docs/swagger`.

## Quick Start

1. Place all app code in their corresponding folders.
2. Edit the OpenAPI spec as your APIs evolve.
3. Serve docs locally:  
   `npx serve .` or `python3 -m http.server`  
   Then visit: `http://localhost:5000/docs/swagger/`
4. Push to GitHub. Vercel will deploy each app via monorepo configuration.
5. [Optional] Use `/docs/swagger` as your API docs site.

## Deployment

- This repo is ready to deploy with Cloud Run and GitHub Actions.
- See `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for CI/CD config.
